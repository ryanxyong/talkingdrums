    <h1>How Talking Drums Talk</h1>

      <h2>General Overview</h2>
      <p>
        People talk through drums by mimicking human speech patterns in the language of their choosing. These languages are often tonal, meaning different pitches correspond to different grammatical forms or meanings entirely. Some drums require one to physically increase the pitch of the instrument while others require different drum hitting techniques to denote different tones.

        An example of a drum that requires one to physically change the instrument pitch is the Ghanaian Dondo drum, shown in the gallery above. This is the same drum that Professor Shabazz was playing on the home page. The Dondo drum is a two-headed drum played with a stick. It has many strings going from one head to the other. The player places the drum between their arm and their torso. In order to make the instrument talk, Professor Shabazz skillfully squeezes down on the strings between the heads that surround the body of the drum. This tightens up the drumhead to produce a higher pitch sound than before, achieving a high tone on the Dondo drum. The degree to which one squeezes down on the drum determines the tone. When using these tones, he replicates the tones of the spoken words, which is how one speaks through the Dondo drum. We analyze Professor Shabazz’s playing <a href="purposes.html">here</a>.

        Another example is the Yorùbá Gángan drum, a type of dùndún drum. In the video above (shot by Professor McPherson), we see a member of the Benin musical group Atawunda play the Gángan. This instrument is a two-headed drum played with a stick, like the Dondo drum, and is nestled under the arm and rested on the leg. In this short clip, we see the drummer playing various tones by gripping a bunch of strings in his hand with various strengths to manipulate the tones of the sounds produced by the drum. Furthermore, the people and drummer are “speaking” together as we hear the tones produced by the drum closely reflecting the same tones of the people talking.
