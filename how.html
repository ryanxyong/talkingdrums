    <h1>How Talking Drums Talk</h1>

      <h2>General Overview</h2>
      <p>
        People talk through drums by mimicking human speech patterns in the language of their choosing. These languages are often tonal, meaning different pitches correspond to different grammatical forms or meanings entirely. These drums require one to physically increase the pitch of the instrument.

        An example of a drum that requires one to physically change the instrument pitch is the Tama drum, shown in the gallery above. This is the same drum that Professor Shabazz was playing on the home page. The Tama drum is a two-headed drum played with a stick. It has many strings going from one head to the other. The player places the drum between their arm and their torso. In order to make the instrument talk, Professor Shabazz skillfully squeezes down on the strings between the heads that surround the body of the drum. This tightens up the drumhead to produce a higher pitch sound than before, achieving a high tone on the Tama drum. The degree to which one squeezes down on the drum determines the tone. When using these tones, he replicates the tones of the spoken words, which is how one speaks through the Tama drum. We analyze Professor Shabazz’s playing <a href="purposes.html">here</a>.

        Another example is the Yorùbá ìyá ìlù drum, a type of dùndún drum that is also called the mother drum. In the video above (courtesy of Professor McPherson), we see a member of the Benin musical group Atawunda play the ìyá ìlù. This instrument is a two-headed drum played with a stick, like the Tama drum, and is nestled under the arm and rested on the leg. In this short clip, we see the drummer playing various tones by gripping a bunch of strings in his hand with various strengths to manipulate the tones of the sounds produced by the drum. This clip also illustrates how the talking drum parallels the tones found in the spoken language as the people join the drummer and start singing too. The tones of the words spoken by the people and the tones produced by the talking drum player followed each other as the tones rose and fell and vice-versa.

      <h2>Linguistic Breakdown: Yorùbá</h2>
      <p>
        In continuing our discussion of the dùndún, we now talk about the linguistic data for the Gángan, another type of dùndún, that demonstrates how the people use the drum to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We first discuss word formation in Standard Yorùbá to understand how various rhythms form when playing the Gángan (Akinbo 2021).  Word formation in Standard Yorùbá follows a CV (consonant vowel) form. Different forms and of words have different numbers of drum hits associated with them. A CV word is associated with one hit; a CVCV or VCV word is associated with two hits; a CVV word is associated with one hit for natural settings and two hits for more careful situations. For example, ràá is of CVV form and can be played with one or two strikes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we examine the power of lexical tones. Fundamentally, this talking drum speaks by using three different tone levels: H (high), M (middle), and L (low) tones (Akinbo 2021). As mentioned above, one does this by tightening the strings of the drum. Putting no tension on the strings creates the L tones; putting some tension on the strings creates the M tones; putting tight tension on the strings creates the H tones. For example, rá (H tone) means ‘disappear’, ra (M tone) means ‘rub’, and rà (L tone) means ‘buy.’ As such, we see how different levels of tone can completely change the definition of a word, which allows players of talking drums to clearly articulate different words just with tones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we examine grammatical uses of H and M tones to illustrate how grammatical tones work with talking drums. The H tone can be placed between two words to denote the subject, which comes before the tone (Akinbo 2021). The M tone can be placed between two words to denote that the second word possesses the first word. Because these are more tones, the talking drum can also replicate these grammatical tones while communicating to someone else.
