      <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Although literature regarding the origin of talking drums is thin, a study suggeststhat talking drums originated from the Ghana Empire people, Hausa people, or Yorùbá people (Discourse et al.). All of these groups of people came from West Africa, so the literature suggests that, at the very least, talking drums originated from West Africa.

      <p>
        Sometimes, these beliefs regarding the origin of talking drums stem from a long-standing cultural norm. In the case of the dùndún, the Yorùbá talking drum, many believe that the drum came from the inventor Kunsanri Àyàn, the drum god, in ancient city Ọỳọ (Durojaye 2020). Because the drum Àyàn created is still played, people who play the dùndún not only praise Àyàn but identify as a child of the drum god, or ọmọ Àyàn. Deeply engrained beliefs, such as those found in Yorùbá culture, illustrate the creation of not only a drum but a group of people who feel closely and culturally related to their drum.
