      <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Because most languages in the world only have a spoken, or played, component, recorded information regarding the origin of languages tends to be sparse. This statement still stands in the case of talking drums, which has even less information on the topic as an additional medium by which people speak a language. A study suggests that talking drums originated from the Ghana Empire people, Hausa people, or Yorùbá people (Discourse et al. 2021). Interestingly, all these groups of people are from West Africa, which means that it is likely that talking drums originated from the same region on the continent at the very least. As such, we fix our focus of talking drums on West Africa.

        Although the information may not be perfect, one must note that, as the medium for communicating ideas and culture, languages carry history. By the same token, we turn to talking drum players, who often bear the knowledge regarding the origin of their drums. Take, for example, the Yorùbá talking drum: the dùndún. Many Yorùbá believe that this drum came from the inventor Kunsanri Àyàn, the drum god, in ancient city Ọỳọ (Durojaye 2020). The drum Àyàn created is still played today, and the people who play the dùndún not only praise Àyàn but identify as the children of the drum god, or ọmọ Àyàn. Through long-standing and deeply engrained beliefs, such as those found in Yorùbá culture, one can discover the possible origins of a talking drum. The tight relationship between talking drums and those who play them illustrate stories of creating the drum but a group of people who feel closely and culturally related to their drum.

        Before we closely examine the impact and use of talking drums today, we must first contextualize why talking drums were even used in the first place. These drums were used to communicate with others over long distances. In the 1700s, locals in Africa played the drums to signal nearby villages of attacks and ceremonies (Discourse et al. 2021). Although the human voice is distinct, it may not be audible over the miles of distance between villages. As such, large talking drums could take on the role as the sole medium for long-distance communication between villages. Moreover, these talking drums could prevent European colonists from understanding internal communications among the locals, which restored power and privacy back to the Africans. Other uses included uniting people, settling conflicts between people, and recording the history of important societal events (Ushe 2015).
