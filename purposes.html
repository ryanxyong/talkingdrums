    <h1>Purposes for Talking Drums</h1>

      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>
        The main reason for using a talking drum was for the sake of long-range communication. However, today with the rise of smartphones and other more efficient mechanisms for communicating over very long distances, talking drums are used less frequently today than they were hundreds of years ago (Ushe 2015). This is not to say that the talking drums are unused in society. For example, talking drums allows one to circumvent the repercussions of a criticism of or a direct response to another individual. If one were to say it themselves, then there the message will be interpreted as the person directly saying it to the listener. However, speaking through the talking drums changes the perception of the message to the listener because it is the drum doing the talking, not the person. This illustrates how talking drums have the special property of altering or softening the nuance or tone of a comment that could likely appear disrespectful or hostile when expressed verbally. The Yorùbá dùndún is also still used in palaces as the talking drum player will let the king know of any visitors or guests and other pertinent information (Durojaye 2020). The continued usage of the talking drums underscores the irreplaceable effectiveness of the drum even by modern standards.

      <h2>Announcements</h2>
      <p>
        Given how loud a talking drum can be, they act as a great way to announce messages to a whole village or even villages at once. We cover a couple major examples of events where the talking drum is used, including but not limited to the death of an important social figure and hunting expeditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, talking drums can be played when a person of major social status passes away. For example, in North Central Nigeria, the Tiv drum the following message (translated to English) (Ushe 2015, 114).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Takuruku, Tiger cat in the world above wait, attends, Takuruku,<br>
        Wait for your brother, who is on his way to the place of the great,<br>
        Takuruku, wait to attend, wait for your brother who is on the way,<br>
        Anyamazenga, wait to attend,<br>
        Wait for your brother who is on his way to the great beyond.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This translation from Ushe refers to Takuruku Anyamazenga, who is considered the founding father of the Tiv people. The sending off the important person in this honorable way has been a tradition for a long time. The talking drums play the significant role of breaking this news to everyone in the village.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, talking drums are played to indicate that people are setting off a hunting expedition. For instance, the Nkundo tribe play the following message (translated to English) (Carrington 1949, 640).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        when morning has come<br>
        the net on the shoulder, staff in hand<br>
        let us go into the forest<br>
        let us go hunting with sticks (on which to hang the net)<br>
        mbambi la mboloko la mbuli<br>
        look out for a good place<br>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In order to properly broadcast this message to the large audience in the village, the Nkundo tribe utilize the talking drums. In this way, the village will be aware of the whereabouts of those who went hunting.

      <h2>War</h2>

        In the video above, Professor Shabazz plays a Ghanaian rhythm played during wars on his talking drum. This rhythm has two sections. The first section, from the beginning of the video to 0:53, is played to get the attention of the listeners. It says, “Listen Ghana. Listen Ghana. If you kill a thousand Ashantis, say it, and say it quickly because soon another thousand will take their place.” This section acts as a warning sign to never let one’s guard down as the battle is not over. Amazingly, this is all communicated through the talking drum that all the warriors can understand. The second section, from 0:53 to the end of the video, is played to tell the warriors to fight. This section of the rhythm can be played endlessly for the heat of war until the battle is over. This repetitive section of the rhythm is specifically to encourage the warriors and to give them the power needed to keep fighting until the end. This rhythm typically has a setup with bells and five to six drums of varying sizes, which creates a loud group of drummers that can be heard on the battlefield.
