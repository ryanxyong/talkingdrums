    <h1>Purposes for Talking Drums</h1>

      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>
        The main reason for using a talking drum was for the sake of long-range communication. However, today with the rise of smartphones and other more efficient mechanisms for communicating over very long distances, the talking drums are used less frequently today than they were hundreds of years ago (Ushe 2015). This is not to say that the talking drums are unused in society. For example, by using the talking drums, one can circumvent the repercussions of a controversial take or directly responding to someone. If one were to say it themselves, then there the message will be interpreted as the person directly saying it to the listener. However, speaking through the talking drums changes the perception of the message to the listener because it is the drum doing the talking, not the person. The Yorùbá dùndún is also still used in palaces as the talking drum player will let the king know of any visitors or guests and other pertinent information (Durojaye 2020). The enduring usage of the talking drums underscores the irreplaceable effectiveness of the drum even in today’s standards.

        In the video above, Professor Shabazz plays a Ghanaian rhythm played during wars on his talking drum. This rhythm has two sections. The first section, from the beginning of the video to 0:53, is played to get the attention of the listeners. It says, “Listen Ghana. Listen Ghana. If you kill a thousand Ashantis, say it, and say it quickly because soon another thousand will take their place.” This section acts as a warning sign to never let one’s guard down as the battle is not over. Amazingly, this is all communicated through the talking drum that all the warriors can understand. The second section, from 0:53 to the end of the video, is played to tell the warriors to fight. This section of the rhythm can be played endlessly for the heat of war until the battle is over. This repetitive section of the rhythm is specifically to encourage the warriors and to give them the power needed to keep fighting until the end. This rhythm typically has a setup with bells and five to six drums of varying sizes, which creates a loud drum group that can be heard on the battlefield.
