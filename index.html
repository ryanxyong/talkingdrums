        <h2>More Than Just Sounds</h2>
        <p>
          In the video above, Professor Shabazz at Dartmouth College played a talking drum rhythm. For those who did not grow up speaking a talking drum language, one may fail to realize that the rhythm was a meaningful phrase. The world of talking drums presents a profound dimension of language that utilizes drums, which often goes underappreciated. To understand this all, one must first understand what a language is.

        <h2>What is a language?</h2>
        <p>
          As defined by the Oxford English Dictionary, a language is a "system of spoken or written communication used by a particular country, people, community, etc., typically consisting of words used within a regular grammatical and syntactic structure; (also) a formal system of communication by gesture, esp. as used by deaf people."
        </p>

        <p>
          We take this definition and extend the idea of the "system of spoken or written communication" to the idea of speaking through drums. Although using drums as speech may not be the first thought that comes to mind, it is worth reimagining our understanding of languages to include speaking through instruments because there are many regions in the world that do so!
        </p>

        <h2>How do drums and languages intersect?</h2>
        <p>
          A drum player can manipulate the sound produced by the drums to denote various meanings. The idea of speech surrogates links drums and languages. A speech surrogate is defined as "a system in which the content of a (usually) spoken language is transferred onto some non-linguistic form." In this case, the drums act as the non-linguistic form by which talking drummers can communicate with other fellow talking drummers. We explore this topic further in this section <a href="how.html">here</a>.

        <h2>Where is West Africa?</h2>
        <p>
          In exploring talking drums, we put our focus on West Africa. Here, historically, many villages utilize drums, specifically talking drums as a major form of communication. As such, the country is rich through prolonged exposure and use of talking drums.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are 16 countries in West Africa as defined by the UN: Cape Verde, Mauritania, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Niger, Nigeria. We denote each country in the map below with blue pins.
