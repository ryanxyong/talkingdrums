        This project on talking drums and how they preserve culture would not have been possible without the help of Professor Laura McPherson, Associate Professor of Linguistics at Dartmouth College, and Professor Hafiz F. Shabazz, Adjunct Associate Professor at Dartmouth College. I thank Professor McPherson for providing me with wonderful materials that she had acquried through her own research. I thank Professsor Shabazz for his time and thoughtfulness as he demonstrated how talking drums work and told me about his experiences. I am grateful for all the support they have given me as I took on this endeavor to not only learn about but produce information on talking drums.
