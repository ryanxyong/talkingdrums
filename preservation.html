    <h1>Cultural Preservation Through Talking Drums</h1>

        Languages themselves act as the vehicle for preserving cultures. While discussing languages and culture, Obiegbu highlights how “concepts are stored in the memory through the medium of language, and thinking proceeds from remembered concepts and propositions which are converted into speech” (2016). Talking drums speak through a previously established language rather than a unique one. In other words, for instance, if a group of people speak Yorùbá, then when they communicate with each other through talking drums, they will replicate Yorùbá through the drum tones and rhythms. Because these drums use an existing language for talking, the memory that Obiegbu refers to is stored through speech of talking drums too. Talking drums use rhythms and tones to hold the information of historical events and traditions that contribute to a group’s culture.

        Talking drums contain many traditions as they have been around for so long. For example, as discussed in the purposes of talking drums section, these drums long been played in various situations including wars, announcements to the villagers of some news, and communicating. Consequently, the methods of communicating information are passed down from talking drum player to player, which illustrates how the younger generation inherits the culture. Moreover, the case of Yorùbá regarding the talking drum player for the Alaafin (the Owner of the Palace in Oyo) demonstrates the profound depth of knowledge that the drummers themselves have, which they pass down (Discourse et al. 2021). After the Alaafin wakes up to the sound of the drum early in the morning, the drummer plays Oriki, a type of praise, of previous Alaafins to the current Alaafin. The Oriki contain critical information regarding events and conflicts that the previous Alaafins encountered as well as what they did to successfully handle the problem. Because the information the talking drum player holds pertains to the lives of previous Alaafins and what they did, the drummers transmit and preserve the cultures and traditions of the past for the current Alaafin to learn as well. Additionally, the talking drums can be used as the mediator between people and deities. For example, the Yorùbá believe that the Dùndún can do this by invoking deities and spirits when worshipping them (Durojaye 2020). In using the Dùndún to maintain the belief of communicating with deities, the talking drum also preserves the religious aspect of the people’s culture.

        By keeping the information regarding the means of communicating, lives of previous rulers, and religious practices intact, talking drums preserve the culture of a group of people.
