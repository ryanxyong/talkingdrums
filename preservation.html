    <h1>Cultural Preservation Through Talking Drums</h1>

        Languages themselves act as the vehicle for preserving cultures. While discussing languages and culture, Obiegbu highlights how “concepts are stored in the memory through the medium of language, and thinking proceeds from remembered concepts and propositions which are converted into speech” (2016). Talking drums speak through a previously established language rather than a unique one. In other words, for instance, if a group of people speak Yorùbá, then when they communicate with each other through talking drums, they will replicate Yorùbá through the drum tones and rhythms. Because these drums use an existing language for talking, the memory that Obiegbu refers to is stored through speech of talking drums too. Talking drums use rhythms and tones to hold the information of historical events and traditions that contribute to a group’s culture.

        Talking drums contain many traditions as they have been around for so long. For example, as discussed in the purposes of talking drums section, these drums long been played in various situations including wars, announcements to the villagers of some news, and communicating. Consequently, the methods of communicating information are passed down from talking drum player to player, which illustrates how the younger generation inherits the culture. Moreover, the case of Yorùbá regarding the talking drum player for the Alaafin (the Owner of the Palace in Oyo) demonstrates the profound depth of knowledge that the drummers themselves have, which they pass down (Agha et al. 2021). After the Alaafin wakes up to the sound of the drum early in the morning, the drummer plays Oriki, a type of praise, of previous Alaafins to the current Alaafin. The Oriki contain critical information regarding events and conflicts that the previous Alaafins encountered as well as what they did to successfully handle the problem. Because the information the talking drum player holds pertains to the lives of previous Alaafins and what they did, the drummers transmit and preserve the cultures and traditions of the past for the current Alaafin to learn as well. Additionally, the talking drums can be used as the mediator between people and deities. For example, the Yorùbá believe that the dùndún can do this by invoking deities and spirits when worshipping them (Durojaye 2020). In using the dùndún to maintain the belief of communicating with deities, the talking drum also preserves the religious aspect of the people’s culture.

        By keeping the information regarding the means of communicating, lives of previous rulers, and religious practices intact, talking drums preserve the culture of a group of people.

      <h3>Key Points</h3>
      <p>
        We first discuss Professor Shabazz’s background and his early journey into drumming. Professor Shabazz started out with bongos as a physical outlet but eventually started lessons and worked his way to playing with groups. However, in the US, he came to the realization that drumming in public was illegal through his encounter with the authorities in 1957/1958 when they destroyed his drums. He channeled his aggravated energy to becoming a wonderful drummer. In high school, he got into jazz drums and African drums after meeting a Ghanaian drummer. Later, he met a master drummer and who helped him grow as a drummer who could play with dance groups. The dance group he was with at the time planned to go to Ghana, and Professor Shabazz was able to follow them too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we talk about Professor Shabazz’s experience regarding drums and culture. He embarked on his journey as an ethnomusicologist in Africa and Cuba to rediscover his own culture. He felt that his education in the United States failed to properly educate him on his wonderful cultural background, so he took the opportunity to join the trip to Ghana in high school to start this journey. Here, he learned about the tonalities of drums and the Ghanaian languages. After Ghana, Professor Shabazz traveled to Cuba, where he closely identified with the African-Cuban music because he felt it was relevant to the African-American music of his background. While in Cuba, he learned about how drums were core to functions in society such as rituals, ceremonies, coming of age events, and dances. As such, drums help preserve culture in this case because the rhythms played in these events tell the story of traditions of a society.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, in directly speaking on how talking drums can preserve culture, Professor Shabazz details how the tonal rhythms from talking drums are found in today’s rap or hip-hop. He says rappers “have taken their African culture internally and then gave it to the world.” The African culture he refers to here is the use of talking drums as communication. For example, beats in a rap song are sometimes rhythms with different tones, which Professor Shabazz discusses and demonstrates at 43:00 to 44:00 in the video. Moreover, good talking drum players are required to have a deep knowledge of their culture, which they spread around and about as they can use the talking drums as a “memory device” to peek into the past (Durojaye 2020, 17). As such, we see how talking drums can preserve one’s culture through societal events like rituals and other ceremonies. Furthermore, one can also observe that talking drums are manifesting in new forms, such as rap or hip-hop, and as a medium for educating individuals, so they may be well-versed in their culture and history.
